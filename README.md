# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Requirements
The first part of this project required me to calculate several metrics by city type for PyBer rides. Those metrics were total number of rides, total number of drivers, total fares generated, average fare per ride and average fare per driver. I then needed to calculate the total fares generated per week by city type for the first four months of 2019.
### Tasks
1. Create a summary dataset that illustrates the differences in ride data by city type.
  a. Calculate the total rides given by city type
  b. Calculate the number of drivers by city type
  c. Calculate the sum of all fares by city type
  d. Calculate the average fare per ride by city type
  e. Calculate the average fare earned per driver by city type
2. Create a graph that illustrates the differences in fares generated by city type.
  a. Reindex the complete ride dataset by date and city type
  b. Pivot the new dataset to show total fares earned each day by city type
  c. Create the line graph to show information
### Purpose
The outcomes of this project (summary dataset, fare graph) can help PyBer executives make decisions about where new drivers might need to be located and help identify where fare rates might need to be adjusted. 

## Results:
After calculating the information needed for the summary dataset and weekly fares generated we see the following:

This shows us that while the total fares generated for PyBer in rural cities is significatly less that total fares earned in urban cities, the individual rides in rural cities generate higher fares than the rides in urban cities. There were 13 times more rides given in urban cities than in rural cities; however, there were 30 times more drivers. Each driver in urban cities earned 70% less per ride than their counterparts in rural cities. Rural drivers gave 1.6 rides per driver while urban drivers only gave .68 rides per driver. 

## Summary
Further analysis is need to determine if changes are needed at PyBer. If an individual is looking to become a driver for PyBer they may consider being a driver for a rural city since it appears as though they would making more money. PyBer should look at the demand in rural areas, are there rides being turned away because there are too few drivers and revenue is being lost? Rural drivers gave 1.6 rides per driver while urban drivers only gave .68 rides per driver. The urban market looks to be overly saturated with drivers.
